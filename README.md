Hello,
Here is my assigned task, Completed!
In order to evaluate my assignment you need to do the following things first:
1) run 'npm install' in the project folder to install all the required node_modules.
2) Start a connection in MongoDB compass community with connection ID 27017 (universal), rest will be handled automatically.
3) run 'nodemon server.js' in a different terminal to connect the backend of the project.
That's all, now you can use the application as obvious.
Thank you.

**NOTE: 
1)There is a problem with CORS in the backend. Trying to figure it out...
2) Use 'Back' button wherever required.
